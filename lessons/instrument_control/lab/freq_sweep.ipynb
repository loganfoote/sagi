Concatenate the two log strings. We will be varying the function generator frequency and oscilloscope xscale throughout the project, so set these values to the string `'VARIABLE'` in the log file. We will log them later. You may want to change the y scale of the oscilloscope depending on the transmission through your circuit, so ensure that it is a variable parameter."

    "You have developed the code you need to perform a frequency sweep, and now you want to wrap the code into a single function to use for the rest of the lab. Write this function and move it to 'freq_sweep.py'. Run the code from this notebook to test it. You may find that you need to add a few sleep statements to stop the code from trying to run before the previous command is finished. In practice, you will use 'get' commands or other methods to force your code to wait until each command is set on the instrument, but we are doing the quick-and-easy method of using sleep statements for now. Now that you have combined your code into a function in the .py file, are there any other functions you need to write to read in the data? Hint: where do you get your frequency list when you import the data?"
