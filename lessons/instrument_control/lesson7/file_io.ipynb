    "### NPY files\n",
    "CSV files are great for many applications, but they are inefficient for large amounts of data. For example, if we want to store a float64 value, we require 8 bits of storage space. In order to store the same float as ASCII text in a csv file, we need 8 bits per digit, which comes out to 2-20 times more storage space. This is valuable storage space on our computer, but also increased time for writing and reading data. The binary file type can be used instead to store data in a much more efficient format. In Python, the `numpy` package has a convenient and efficient method for reading and writing binary files. In this particular format, the files will have the '.npy' extension."
